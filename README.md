# Python

I am learning how to code using python.
To begin with I am going through the video lectures by MIT professor Anne bell, available here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-videos/
I am trying the codes that she is working with. 

# In Lecture 3 we learnt about 3 algorithma to solve one problem - finding cube root.
1. Guess and Check method: Also called as Exhaustive ennumeration: The strategy for the method “Guess and Check” is to guess a solution and then plug the guess back into the problem to see if you get the correct answer. If the answer is too big or too small, make another guess that will get you closer to the goal, and continue guessing until you arrive at the correct solution
Code can be seen here: https://github.com/ritzmeya/Python/commit/40ae718d87c84db4012af65541e9d8d2d0b9a7fd
