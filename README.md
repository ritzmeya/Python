# Python

I am learning how to code using python.
To begin with I am going through the video lectures by MIT professor Anne bell, available here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-videos/
I am trying the codes that she is working with.
