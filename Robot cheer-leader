### learning how to use for loops and while loops and indexing and strings to write a code

an_letters = "aefhilmnorsxAEFHILMNORSX"
word = input ("I WILL CHEER FOR YOU! ENTER A WORD: ")
times = int (input ("Enthusiasm level (1-10): "))


i = 0
while i <len(word):
    char = word[i]
    if char in an_letters:
        print ("Give me an " + char + " ! " + char)
    else:
        print ("Give me a " +char + "! " + char)
    i += 1
print ("what does that spell?")
for i in range (times) :
    print (word, "!!!")
